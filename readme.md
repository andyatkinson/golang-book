### Notes

 * go run helloworld.go
 * short variable declaration (`:=`) serves as a declaration and initialization, staticly typed, short for `var name string; name = "John"`
 * `panic` and `recover` for exception handling
 * `*` pointer, followed by type, also used to dereference a pointer
 * `new` can be used to create a pointer
 * `&` find the address of a variable, `&x` returns a pointer to a type, e.g. `*int`
